Exile Infinity
==============

This project hosts the source code of Exile Infinity, an extension of the classic RPG creator Blades of Exile, after it was released by [Spiderweb Software](http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/) under GPLv2.

The primary purposes of this project are to take Blades of Exile in a new direction it has not been taken before: Procedural generation; in addition to updating its code so that it can run on modern operating systems. The secondary purpose is to generalize and extend its functionality, sacrificing backwards compatibility if that is needed.

If you would like to be added to this project contact [World Wizard 89](https://github.com/wrldwzrd89) or one of the other people on the owners list. This is an open project, with no strong prerequisites for getting commit access. With that in mind, please be careful of what you check into the repository. Please do not commit any binaries, junk files, or anything that doesn't compile.

Building
--------

A formal build process and tools are not required, thanks to the use of [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) and its [simple packaging method](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution) behind the curtains. It is even possible to cross-package (make a Windows build on Linux, for example).
